### Why blockchain?

- **Data immutability:** Once the data is placed on the blockchain, it is permanent and cannot be changed or deleted without the consent of the majority of network participants. This ensures that data related to employee-employer relationships is authentic and immutable

- **Transparency and credibility:** The decentralised nature of blockchain means that all participants in the network have access to the same data, ensuring transparency and trust in the process

- **Autonomy:** Blockchain enables the automation of many processes through smart contracts, which are computer programs that run on the blockchain. These can be used to automatically record events

- **Data security:** Blockchain provides a high level of data security through the use of a cryptographic algorithm and the distributed nature of the network. Each block of data is linked to the previous one through complex cryptographic functions, making it difficult to alter or forge data

### Why Linkedin?

- **Application purpose:** It is not intended to be a competitor to Linkedin, but rather an extension of its functionality

- **Business connections:** In the application described, which aims to establish an employee-employer relationship, LinkedIn is a natural choice because of its business relevance and representation of professional networks

- **User Credibility:** Using LinkedIn accounts for authentication can provide greater credibility to users. Because information on LinkedIn is often verified and more difficult to fake than on other social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, authentication through LinkedIn can minimize the risk of fake profiles

- **Minimize data duplication:** LinkedIn contains a wealth of information that can be useful in the context of an application, such as work experience, skills or education. Using LinkedIn authentication, an application can access this data without requiring users to re-enter it, minimizing data duplication and streamlining the registration process

- **Simplified registration process:** Users often prefer a quick and convenient registration process. Authentication via LinkedIn can simplify this process by eliminating the need for users to enter new information or create a new account; they simply sign in using their existing LinkedIn account

# Goals and motivations

### Business goals:

- **Verification and Guarantee of Employment:** Creating a tool that allows companies and employees to verify their employment history in an unquestionable and immutable way through the use of blockchain technology. This provides both employers and employees with confidence in the reliability of employment information

- **Trust and Authenticity of Reviews:** Today's review platforms are often vulnerable to fake reviews or manipulation. I wanted to create a system where reviews about employers and employees are based on real experiences, ensuring the integrity and credibility of the reviews

- **Streamlining Recruitment Processes:** With the ability to verify employment history via blockchain, the application can significantly streamline recruitment processes for employers and increase their efficiency by eliminating the need for manual data verification

- **Increasing Employee Engagement:** With the ability to build a reputation and receive honest reviews, employees may feel more motivated to engage in their work, potentially leading to increased employee retention

- **Promoting Fair Competition:** By providing the ability to prove the authenticity of references and reviews, the application can promote fair competition in the labour market, rewarding commitment and competence
