### Why blockchain?

- **Data immutability:** Once the data is placed on the blockchain, it is permanent and cannot be changed or deleted without the consent of the majority of network participants. This ensures that data related to employee-employer relationships is authentic and immutable

- **Transparency and credibility:** The decentralised nature of blockchain means that all participants in the network have access to the same data, ensuring transparency and trust in the process

- **Autonomy:** Blockchain enables the automation of many processes through smart contracts, which are computer programs that run on the blockchain. These can be used to automatically record events

- **Data security:** Blockchain provides a high level of data security through the use of a cryptographic algorithm and the distributed nature of the network. Each block of data is linked to the previous one through complex cryptographic functions, making it difficult to alter or forge data
