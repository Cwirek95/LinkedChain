# 4.  Use Rust and Substrate Framework for blockchain part of the application

Date: 2024-03-01

## Problem

I needed to find a flexible and secure solution for creating smart contracts on the blockchain network.

## Decision

I decided on a solution using the Rust language and the Substrate framework, which uses the Polkadot network.

## Consequences

- While Substrate and Rust offer numerous benefits, learning and mastering these technologies can take considerable time and effort
- We limit our smart contracts to the Polkadot network
- It will be necessary to keep up to date with updates, use available resources, and participate in the Substrate Framework community
